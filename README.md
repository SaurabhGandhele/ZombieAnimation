# ZombieAnimation

Install the .apk on your android device and print the base image on a white paper.

Connect the android device with Google cardboard or other virtual reality device.

Paste the printed base image paper on a solid book cover or a thick rectangle object to get a better real experience.

Play the animation by touching the virtual button and by zooming the zombie for transformation effects...
